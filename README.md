# artemis
A tiny RSS aggregator made with [sqlx](https://github.com/launchbadge/sqlxhttps://github.com/launchbadge/sqlx), [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/). 

## Motive
I like to be up-to-date on new blog posts and news. I want to know when I have already read something and I don't want to use any third party services for synchronizing my RSS lists.

## Roadmap
- [] Add support for adding feeds from the UI
- [] Authentication
- [] Infinite scrolling
- [] Optimize logic for saving the feeds.
- [] Add feed categories
- [] Ability to mark feed entries as read
